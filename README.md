I am currently pursuing a Master in Science, majoring in Applied Quantitative Economics and Analysis at Pace University. For my undergraduate capstone project, I conducted research on the correlation between Bitcoin and conventional investment assets (S&P 500, gold, the US dollar) under the influence of a negative shock. Under flights to safe theory, investors reallocate their capital from risky asset to safer asset in time of extreme market uncertainty in order to hedge risk. The result suggested Bitcoin is currently behaving more similar to a risky speculative investment asset rather than a safe hideout during market turmoils. Using my code for this project, one can replace (or add) other invesment assets as they preferred.
